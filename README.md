# OSINT-Reddit
Python Script for pulling a Reddit post and the comment threads to the post

Hi, I needed to document and save Reddit threads for a story I was working on, and developed this Python script to do so on iPad.  This script is optimized for Juno, ensuring compatibility while maintaining all features:
- Works in Juno (Jupyter Notebook on iPad)
- Saves the file with the Reddit post title
- Sanitizes filenames to remove invalid characters
- Handles JSON errors gracefully
- Prints the saved file path for easy access
